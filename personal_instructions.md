# Databricks Assistant â€“ Personal Instructions (Kristian)

These apply only to my user context.  
They let me override workspace defaults where needed.

---

## Coding Conventions
- Keep using **snake_case** (agree with workspace).

## Data Sources
- No override.

## Visualization
- Always prefer **Plotly** for visualizations (override workspace).

## Presentation
- Monetary values should not have currency prefix, only numeric with 2 decimals. (override workspace)
